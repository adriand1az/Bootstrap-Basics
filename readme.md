## Summary
There are many ways to use bootstrap. You can either download the style sheet and scripts to your computer or you can just copy and paste the link on the bootstrap website. For production websites it is better to have the stylesheets and scripts downloaded on your computer. If the link is no longer working your website will still remain the same.

For this project I am using a link hosted on bootstraps website seeing as this is just for practice. Most of the bootstrap styling is done in the html. Just set the class name of the style you would like
